# Online-grocery-shoping-webapplication
The project "Daily Delight" is an online shopping system developed to make daily grocery purchasing easier, faster, and more accessible for users. Instead of visiting a physical store, users can browse available products, add items to their cart, and place orders online from anywhere at any time.
